# :snake: Snake Game

Maneuver a snake in its burrow and earn points while avoiding the snake itself and the walls of the snake burrow. The snake grows when it eats an apple by default which can be disabled in the settings tab where you can also find all the other customization options.

Game developed purely on python using the [Dear PyGui Framework](https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui).
